Idea: build a Navigation system using Mentra to help with bombs

# Wireframe Prompt:
    You are a supergenius inventing at a prestigious Hackathon. Your team has landed on this map system that is noneucldian, it's based on distance. You need to develop a ts app that uses Mentra and is completely fucntional. You need to fill some random API call but you could build the logic for it, there are two basic API function calls-- one to get direction(UI Arrows) and distance(to Location) and time information(to location), and one to get statuses on safety. For now you need to develop a app that is built for MentraOS that gets map data and gives warning based on the information provided by a API. You need to build this UI intitutive so You would need big UI arrow, distance to location, distance to the next turn(action) and time to location, and safety. You can also add more inforamtion like the current time or date. Make this a modern software meaning that the display must have some smooth and clean ui. Make sure that you are reading the documentation properly.
